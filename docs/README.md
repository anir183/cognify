# Cognify 🎓🧠  
**AI-Powered Personalized & Gamified Learning Platform**

Cognify is an AI-driven EdTech platform that delivers **truly personalized learning** through **real-time adaptation**, **performance analysis**, and **gamified experiences**.  
It moves beyond static course structures to dynamically adjust **difficulty, pace, and reinforcement** based on each learner’s performance.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Most EdTech platforms follow a **one-size-fits-all** approach.  
Students with different learning styles, speeds, and strengths are forced into the same rigid structure, resulting in:

- Low engagement  
- Poor knowledge retention  
- Ineffective learning outcomes  

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**Cognify** solves this by combining:

- **AI-based performance analysis**
- **Dynamic difficulty & pacing**
- **Gamification inspired by competitive mechanics**
- **Actionable insights for educators**

The platform adapts continuously to how a student learns — not the other way around.
